## What weâ€™re about

Welcome to the International Strugglers meetup, 
where we believe in the power of supporting each other through life's challenges. 

Whether you're a young adult dealing with mental illness, 
a health-conscious mom, a caring mental health advocate, 
or simply someone striving for a clean and healthy lifestyle, 
this group is for you.

Join us to engage in fun activities, share experiences, and 
seek advice on topics such as healthy living, clean eating, 
family well-being, and creating a healthy environment.

Together, we will navigate the path to physical and 
mental wellness through our shared interests in lifestyle medicine.

You should join if you could answer yes to any of the problems below

- Do you have trouble sleeping?
- Do you feel anxious to do even the smallest of tasks that are out of your comfort zone?
- Do you think you are running in circles with your life and need to find a way out?
- Do you need a support group where people listen to you and can help you achieve mental peace?
